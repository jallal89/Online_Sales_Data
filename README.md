# SQL Project: Online_Sales_Data


## Discription: 
This dataset has information about customers and their orders from online sales data. The dataset has two files, Orders, which include info about customers, such as their name, city, state and more; and the other file is purchase_details, which has details about orders such as profit, quantity, category of sales orders and more.
